> **Purpose**: Maintain session context, memory, and important knowledge base items.

## Knowledge Base Entries (Crucial Agent Memory)
- **Environment**: This project uses Python 3.10.x in a venv at `.\venv`
- **Execution**: Rasa action server runs on port 5055, Rasa server on port 5005. Both must be started in separate terminals.
- **Coding Standards**: All YAML indentation must use 2 spaces, never tabs.
- **Educational Context**: The developer is a beginner — **always** explain concepts clearly via comments and text before implementing.
- **Agent Instructions**: 
  - Every Python function must include a docstring.
  - Every YAML file must include inline comments.
  - Use Windows-compatible commands only. Activate venv before any pip/rasa commands (`.\venv\Scripts\activate`).
  - Create files/milestones one at a time.
  - Generate at least 10 examples per intent when generating training data.

## Current Position
- **Phase**: 3 (completed)
- **Task**: All tasks complete
- **Status**: Verified

## Last Session Summary
Phase 3 (Domain & Dialogue) has been completely executed. General intents have been added, universal rules formulated, and multi-turn stories implemented. The machine learning model was successfully trained using `rasa train`.

## Next Steps
1. Proceed to Phase 4
2. Run `/plan 4` to begin planning Database & Actions.
